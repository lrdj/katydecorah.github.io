After my first year remote, I wrote about [lessons learned](/notes/one-year-remote/). My second year remote, I wrote about [communication](/notes-two-years-remote). My third year remote, I didn't write about anything. For my fourth year, here's something completely different: meal prep.

I've been meal prepping on and off for a couple years now. I think I started by making batches of chili for us to eat during the week, then I started making burrito bowls. I had a long kick of making butter chicken and curries. I've recently upped my meal prep operation to include lunch _and_ dinner for most of the week. That's 16 meals.

My meal prep operation takes approximately 1.5 hours (not including shopping). I spend about 30 minutes the day before chopping up everything and marinating the proteins. Then about an hour cooking.

1. **Choose 1 or 2 recipes that share ingredients.** I pick recipes that usually share a protein and a carb. I find that it's easier to buy protein in bulk and easier (not to mention faster) to prep a big batch of say brown rice, then doing two small batches of different grains.
2. **Invest in nice containers.** I love the [4-cup Pyrex glass containers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DAXO55E/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). They hold generous portions and you don't have to worry about spilling over the edge. If you need something more compact, the [3-cup Pyrex containers](https://www.amazon.com/Pyrex-Rectangle-Storage-Containers-Lids-Use/dp/B01C6QEX08/ref=pd_bxgy_79_2) are also great. They've held up great over the years.
3. **Prep the meal prep.** The night before you do all the cooking, chop up as much of the vegetables and protein as you can.
4. **Start with a clean slate.** Before you start cooking, empty the dishwasher and clean your counters. If you can, leave your dishwasher open while you cook. This way you can dovetail cooking and clean up.
5. **Equipment: food scale, measuring cups, meat thermometer, timer** If you are counting calories, a food scale and measuring cups are a great tool for portioning food. Since I tend to have a lot of things cooking at once, my oven, microwave, and phone timer are usually in use at once, having an extra on hand can prove useful. Get yourself a nice meat thermometer so you can know for sure the internal temperature of the foods you're cooking.
6. **Study your recipes and come up with a game plan.** My goal is to complete cooking in as little time as possible, so this requires efficient cooking. I start by preheating my oven and grill and cook the carb (grains) first as I like to have them in my meal prep containers first. From there, I'll start making whatever takes the longest first.

I guess the real lesson is that taking care of others and yourself requires preparation and time.
