Today my folks and I explored the <a href="http://www.adirondackjournal.com/news/2013/jul/01/work-continues-dean-farm-trail-stony-creek/" data-proofer-ignore>Dean Farm Heritage Trail</a> in Stony Creek. The trail was fairly easy to navigate as it was marked with wooden poles. We were impressed by all of the beautiful bridges, benches, and overlook points.

The creek was buzzing.

I really enjoyed this trail and I cannot wait to go back to see it in the spring.
