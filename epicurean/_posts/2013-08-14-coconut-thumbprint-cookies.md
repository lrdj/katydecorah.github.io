I found this recipe on a late night Pinterest binge. I'm convinced people only post delicious treats at night time to induce stomach howling.

This recipe was easy, but time consuming. You have to roll each cookie into a 1.25" ball and then bread with coconut. And then you have to press a thumbprint in each. I found that the bottom of a 1/4 teaspoon did a much better job than my thumb. The teaspoon came in handy as halfway through baking time, you need to repress all of the thumbprints.

Logic would tell you not to press your bare thumb into dough straight out of the oven, but unfortunately I did it anyway.
